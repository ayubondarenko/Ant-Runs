# Ant-Runs

Java Script, Canvas, Animation (requestAnimationFrame)

Smal Java Script application thar solving task with running ant:


An ant is on an infinite coordinate grid. Ant can

move one cell up (x, y + 1), down (x, y-1), left (x-1, y),

to the right (x + 1, y), one cell per step.

Cells in which the sum of the digits in the X coordinate plus the sum of the digits in

the Y coordinate is greater than 25 unavailable

an ant. For example, a cell with coordinates (59, 79) is not available, because

5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30, which is more than 25.

Â 

How many cells can an ant visit if its initial position (1000,1000), (including the initial cage).


It is necessary to find a number of cells and write a script in the language

Javascript, drawing on the canvas area available to the ant.
